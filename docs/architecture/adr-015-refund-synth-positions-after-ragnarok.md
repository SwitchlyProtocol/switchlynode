# ADR 015: Refund Synth Positions After Ragnarok

## Changelog

- 2024-05-08: Created
- 2024-05-19: Incorporated comments. Added details.

## Status

Proposed

## Context

During a Ragnarok, all funds remaining in pools are returned in a best-effort fashion and any synthetic tokens are burned. When these tokens are burned, they are effectively converted to RUNE and transferred to the Reserve. While synthetic tokens are tracked and associated with specific addresses, enumerating these addresses is not feasible in the current code and therefore this converted RUNE cannot be returned to its owner during the Ragnarok.

While it can't be done in the current code, Multipartite has come up with a method to identify these addresses using THORNode logs and the Flipside databases.

After the recent Ragnarok of the BNB blockchain, roughly 24,601 RUNE was transferred to the Reserve in this manner. This proposal seeks to return the RUNE liquidity behind any burned synthetic tokens to their respective owners.

### Method

By searching through THORNode logs it is possible to identify all pools that sent synth-associated RUNE to the reserve.

```

From these logs, we can identify the pools that transferred RUNE to the Reserve as well as the synth value in RUNE at the time of transfer.

In the THORNode code, pools are set to `Staged` immediately after RUNE transfer to Reserve. We can use this to identify the block number where the RUNE was transferred to Resreve for each pool.

```text
$ docker run --rm --network host -e RPC_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:27148 registry.gitlab.com/ninerealms/cosmoscan 'block_events_listener(lambda h,e: (h,e), types={"pool"}), start=15206145, end=15269760, progress=True'

[15207120, {"type": "pool", "pool": "BNB.ETH-1C9", "pool_status": "Staged"}]
[15207120, {"type": "pool", "pool": "BNB.TWT-8C2", "pool_status": "Staged"}]
[15208560, {"type": "pool", "pool": "BNB.BTCB-1DE", "pool_status": "Staged"}]
[15209280, {"type": "pool", "pool": "BNB.BUSD-BD1", "pool_status": "Staged"}]
[15265440, {"type": "pool", "pool": "BNB.BNB", "pool_status": "Staged"}]
```

We are interested in all addresses that still held synthetic positions at the block number just before the RUNE was transferred. We can use the Flipside databases to identify these addresses.

With a given address, it is then possible to check exactly how much of a synthetic position that address held at the RUNE transfer height where the synths' value was effectively converted to RUNE.

For example, the following is the query in the case of the BNB.BNB pool:

```sql
WITH
transfers_to AS (
  SELECT to_address AS address, asset, amount_e8
  FROM (thorchain.core.fact_transfer_events AS reftable INNER JOIN thorchain.core.dim_block
    ON reftable.dim_block_id = dim_block.dim_block_id)
  WHERE asset = 'BNB/BNB'
    AND block_id <= 15265440
),

transfers_from AS (
  SELECT from_address AS address, asset, -1 * amount_e8 AS amount_e8
  FROM (thorchain.core.fact_transfer_events AS reftable INNER JOIN thorchain.core.dim_block
    ON reftable.dim_block_id = dim_block.dim_block_id)
  WHERE asset = 'BNB/BNB'
    AND block_id <= 15265440
)

SELECT address, asset,
  SUM(amount_e8) / 1e8 AS amount,
  amount * 206909292040 / 2178708870 AS rune_amount
FROM (
  (SELECT * FROM transfers_to)
  UNION ALL
  (SELECT * FROM transfers_from)
)
GROUP BY address, asset
ORDER BY asset ASC, amount DESC
```

### Summary

Using this method, we find roughly 24,601 RUNE to be returned to 1,309 addresses. As a refund must be done by hand with a store-migration, we suggest that only balances greater than 10 RUNE be returned. This reduces the number of addresses which must be refunded to 46 and the amount of RUNE to 24,192.83.

## Alternative Approaches

## Decision

## Detailed Design

The implementation of the store-migration mechanism introduces a small amount of risk which must be managed through rigorous testing and quality assurance measures. The return process must also be implemented with utmost transparency and accountability.

Moreover, while we believe the process used to identify these balances as well as the amounts to return are correct and explained in detail above, the results should be verified.

## Consequences

### Positive

### Negative

### Neutral
