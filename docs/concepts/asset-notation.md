# Asset Notation

THORChain uses a CHAIN.ASSET notation for all assets. TICKER and ID are added where required. The asset full notation is pictured.

![L1 Asset Notation](https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/1/d/skidhZPIsMKQ-XWJWb3EJaQ/image?w=698&h=276&rev=23&ac=1&parent=1ZoJQKvyATQekFbWMk_rqX96K9BSmCArh9e-A_g66wDQ)

Each asset type has a different delimiter, as explained below. Understanding this notation and delimiter is essential for interacting with THORChain, especially when constructing [transaction memos](./memos.md).

There are five kinds of assets within THORChain:

1. [Layer 1 Assets](asset-notation.md#layer-1-assets) - CHAIN.ASSET
1. [Synthetic Assets](asset-notation.md#synthetic-assets) - CHAIN/Asset
1. [Trade Assets](asset-notation.md#trade-assets) - CHAIN~ASSET
1. [Derived Assets](asset-notation.md#derived-assets) - THOR.ASSET
1. [Secured Assets](asset-notation.md#secured-assets) - CHAIN-ASSET

For a complete list of usable Layer 1 (L1) asset names and their shortcuts, refer to the [Shortened Asset Names](./memo-length-reduction.md) documentation. These shortcuts are particularly useful for constructing memos. To learn more about how asset notation is used within memos, visit the [Memo Documentation](./memos.md).

## Examples

| Asset         | Notation                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Bitcoin       | BTC.BTC (Native BTC)                                |
| Bitcoin       | BTC/BTC (Synthetic BTC)                             |
| Bitcoin       | THOR.BTC (Derived BTC)                              |
| Bitcoin       | BTC~BTC (Trade BTC)                                 |
| Bitcoin       | BTC-BTC (Secured BTC)                               |
| Ethereum      | ETH.ETH                                             |
| USDT          | ETH.USDT-0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7 |
| RUNE (NATIVE) | THOR.RUNE                                           |

## Layer 1 Assets

- Layer 1 (L1) chains are always denoted as `CHAIN.ASSET`, e.g. BTC.BTC.
- As two tokens can live on different blockchains, the chain can be used to distinguish them. Example: USDC is on the Ethereum Chain and Avalanche Chain and is denoted as `ETH.USDC` and `AVAX.USDC` respectively; note the contract address (ticker) was removed for simplicity.
- Tickers are added to denote assets and are required in the full name. For EVM based Chains, the ticker is the ERC20 Contract address, e.g. `ETH.USDC-0XA0B86991C6218B36C1D19D4A2E9EB0CE3606EB48`. This ensures the asset is specific to the contract address. The [pools list](https://midgard.ninerealms.com/v2/pools)shows assets using the full notation.

THOR.RUNE is the only RUNE asset in use. All other RUNE assets on other chains are no longer in use and have no value within THORChain.

## Synthetic Assets

- [Synthetic Assets](https://docs.thorchain.org/thorchain-finance/synthetic-asset-model) are denoted as `CHAIN/ASSET` instead of `CHAIN.ASSET`, e.g. Synthetic BTC is `BTC/BTC` and Synthetic USDT is `ETH/USDT.` While Synthetic assets live on the THORChain blockchain, they retain their CHAIN identifier.
- Synthetic Assets can only be created from THORChain-supported L1 assets and are only denoted as `CHAIN/ASSET`, no ticker or ID is required.
- Chain differentiation is also used for Synthetics, e.g. `ETH/USDC` and `AVAX/USDC` are different Synthetic assets created and redeemable on different chains.

## Trade Assets

- Trade Assets are held within a Trade Account and are created from Layer1 assets, denoted as `CHAIN~ASSET`. The Bitcoin trading asset is `BTC~BTC`.
- Unlike synths which are minted as coins in the Cosmos bank module, trade asset balances are recorded in a custom keeper and cannot be transfer from one native address to another.

## Derived Assets

- Derived Assets, currently specific to Lending, are denoted as `THOR.ASSET.` E.g. `THOR.BTC` is Derived Bitcoin.
- All Derived Assets live on the THORChain blockchain and do not have a Chain identifier.
- Currently, Derived Assets are used internally within THORChain only.

## Secured Assets

- Secured Assets are accounted by the Cosmos SDK x/bank module, and are created from Layer1 assets, denoted as `CHAIN-ASSET`. The Bitcoin secured asset is `BTC-BTC`.
- They are fungible and transferrable via a regular MsgSend, can be sent over IBC, and integrate with CosmWasm smart contracts
- Each Secured Asset maintains a balance of the total underlying L1 tokens deposited. The x/bank native token is therefore a share token, representing an ownership of the Asset Pool (as a fraction of the total supply of the share token)
