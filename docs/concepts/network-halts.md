# Network Halts

```admonish warning
If the network is halted, do not send funds. The easiest check to do is if `halted = true` on the inbound addresses endpoint.
```

```admonish info
In most cases funds won't be lost if they are sent when halted, but they may be significantly delayed.
```

```admonish danger
In the worse case if THORChain suffers a consensus halt the `inbound_addresses` endpoint will freeze with `halted = false` but the network is actually hard-halted. In this case running a fullnode is beneficial, because the last block will become stale after 6 seconds and interfaces can detect this.
```

Interfaces that provide LP management can provide more feedback to the user what specifically is paused.

There are levels of granularity the network has to control itself and chains in the event of issues. Interfaces need to monitor these settings and apply appropriate controls in their interfaces, inform users and prevent unsupported actions.

All activity is controlled within [Mimir](https://thornode.ninerealms.com/thorchain/mimir) and needs to be observed by interfaces and acted upon. Also, see a description of [Constants and Mimir](../mimir.md).

Halt flags are Boolean. For clarity `0` = false, no issues and `> 0` = true (usually 1), halt in effect.

## Halt/ Pause Management

Each chain has granular control allowing each chain to be halted or resumed on a specific chain as required. Network-level halting is also possible.

1. **Specific Chain Signing Halt** - Allows inbound transactions but stops the signing of outbound transactions. Outbound transactions are [queued](https://thornode.ninerealms.com/thorchain/queue). This is the least impactful halt.
   1. Mimir setting is `HALTSIGNING[Chain]`, e.g., `HALTSIGNINGETH`
2. **Specific Chain Liquidity Provider Pause -** addition and withdrawal of liquidity are suspended but swaps and other transactions are processed.
   1. Mimir setting is `PAUSELP[Chain]`, e.g., `PAUSELPBCH` for BCH
3. **Specific Chain Trading Halt** - Transactions on external chains are observed but not processed, only [refunds](memos.md#refunds) are given. THORNode's Bifrost is running, nodes are synced to the tip therefore trading resumption can happen very quickly.
   1. Mimir setting is `HALT[Chain]TRADING`, e.g., `HALTBCHTRADING` for BCH
4. **Specific Chain Halt** - Serious halt where transitions on that chain are no longer observed and THORNodes will not be synced to the chain tip, usually their Bifrost offline. Resumption will require a majority of nodes syncing to the tip before trading can commence.
   1. Mimir setting is `HALT[Chain]CHAIN`, e.g., `HALTBCHCHAIN` for BCH.
5. **Specific Pool Liquidity Provider Pause** - suspends deposits into a specific Liquidity Pool
   1. Mimir setting is `PAUSELPDEPOSIT-<Asset>`, e.g., `PAUSELPDEPOSIT-BTC-BTC` for BTC pool

```admonish warning
Chain specific halts do occur and need to be monitored and reacted to when they occur. Users should not be able to send transactions via an interface when a halt is in effect.
```

### **Network Level Halts**

- **Network Pause LP** `PAUSELP = 1` Addition and withdrawal of liquidity are suspended for all pools but swaps and other transactions are processed.
- **Network Pause Lending** `PAUSELOANS = 1` Opening and closing of loans is paused for all loans.
- **Network Trading Halt** `HALTTRADING = 1` Will stop all trading for every connected chain. The THORChain blockchain will continue and native RUNE transactions will be processed.

There is no Network level chain halt setting as the THORChain Blockchain continually needs to produce blocks.

A chain halt is possible in which case Mimir or Midgard will not return data. This can happen if the chain suffers consensus failure or more than 1/3 of nodes are switched off. If this occurs the Dev Discord Server `#interface-alerts` will issue alerts.

```admonish warning
While very rare, a network level halt is possible and should be monitored for.
```

### Secured Asset Halt Management

1. **Global Secured Asset Halt** - Disables deposits and withdrawals of all secured assets across base and App Layers.
   1. Mimir setting is `HaltSecuredGlobal`, set to `1` to disable all operations.
2. **Specific Secured Asset Deposit Halt** - Disables deposits of secured assets in base and App Layer for the specified chain.
   1. Mimir setting is `HaltSecuredDeposit-<Chain>`, e.g., `HaltSecuredDeposit-ETH = 1` disabled deposits for ETH-ETH and all ERC20 secured assets.
3. **Specific Secured Asset Withdrawal Halt** - Same as `HaltSecuredDeposit-<Chain>` except for Secured Asset Withdrawal.
   1. Mimir setting is `HaltSecuredWithdraw-<Chain>`, e.g., `HaltSecuredWithdraw-ETH =``, set to `1`to disable;`0` to enable.

### Smart Contract Halt Management

Smart contract halts, introduced in v3.2.0 (February 2025), control CosmWasm contract execution in the App Layer. These halts pause specific or all contract activities during vulnerabilities, ensuring network security. Interfaces must monitor these settings and prevent unsupported actions.

1. **Global Smart Contract Halt** - Disables all CosmWasm contract executions in the App Layer. Used for critical vulnerabilities or network-wide issues.
   1. Mimir setting is `HaltWasmGlobal`, set to `1` to disable all contracts; `0` to enable.
2. **Contract Code Halt** - Disables all instances of a specific CosmWasm contract by its code checksum. Targets contract code with known issues.
   1. Mimir setting is `HaltWasmCs-<checksum>`, e.g., `HaltWasmCs-4UMPB3SYCM6Z5WRT5DINB66N462U5VVQVDOIFKMP5G55WKRR7VDA` disabled smart code with the checksum `4UMPB3SYCM6Z5WRT5DINB66N462U5VVQVDOIFKMP5G55WKRR7VDA`.
3. **Specific Contract Halt** - Disables a single CosmWasm contract instance by its contract address address suffix (last 6 characters). Isolates a specific contract instance.
   1. Mimir setting is `HaltWasmContract-<address suffix>`, e.g., `HaltWasmContract-w58u9f`, disabled the smart contract with a contract address ending in `w58u9f`.

### TCY Management

Claiming and Staking of $TCY can be enabled and disabled using flags.

- `TCYClaimingSwapHalt`: Enables/disables RUNE-to-TCY swaps in the claiming module (default: 1, halted).
- `TCYStakeDistributionHalt`: Enables/disables distribution of RUNE revenue to TCY stakers (default: 1, halted).
- `TCYStakingHalt`: Enables/disables staking of TCY tokens (default: 1, halted).
- `TCYUnstakingHalt`: Enables/disables unstaking of TCY tokens (default: 1, halted).
- `TCYClaimingHalt`: Enables/disables claiming of TCY tokens for THORFi deposits (default: 1, halted).

### Trade Accounts

**Trade Accounts Pause** `TradeAccountsEnabled = 1` - Adding to and withdrawing from the Trade Account is enabled.

## Monitoring Mimir Keys

```

- **Integration**: App Layer interfaces must poll Mimir settings to detect halts and adjust functionality
- **Alerts**: Subscribe to Dev Discord `#interface-alerts` channel for updates
