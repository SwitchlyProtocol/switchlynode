# This test verifies the maintenance feature which allows node operators to toggle 
# the maintenance flag on their node account.

# Step 1: Create blocks to initialize the chain
type: create-blocks
count: 1

# Step 2: Check initial node account state - should have maintenance flag as false (default)

# Step 3: Set up a second node to test access control
type: tx-deposit
signer: {{ addr_thor_cat }}
coins:
  - asset: "rune"
    amount: "10000000000" # 10,000 RUNE
